Since the introduction of the Java module system in Java 9, I have been looking to a way to configure an automatic build which produces a folder with my application and the required minimum Java environment. My current opinion is not to try to achieve a result with one tool, but with a set of tools each doing where they can do good. In this blog I introduce my current solution.

# The tools



## Maven

## GNU make

## Jlink

# The build process

# Running the example
